## Dependencies

 * Cytoscape.js ^2.7.0
 * jQuery ^1.7 || ^2.0 || ^3.0
 

## Usage instructions

Download the library:
 * via npm: `npm install cytoscape-graphml`,
 * via bower: `bower install cytoscape-graphml`, or
 * via direct download in the repository (probably from a tag).

`require()` the library as appropriate for your project:

CommonJS:
```js
var cytoscape = require('cytoscape');
var jquery = require('jquery');
var graphml = require('cytoscape-graphml');

graphml( cytoscape, jquery ); // register extension
```

AMD:
```js
require(['cytoscape', 'cytoscape-graphml'], function( cytoscape, graphml ){
  graphml( cytoscape ); // register extension
});
```

Plain HTML/JS has the extension registered for you automatically, because no `require()` is needed.
